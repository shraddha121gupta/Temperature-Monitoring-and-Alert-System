# Temperature-Monitoring-and-Alert-System
This project uses LM35 sensor interfaced with bolt WiFi module. The sensor collects temperature at different time and if the temperature at a particular time is greater than the threshold it will send an alert message to my phone via telegram. This project has a wide application such as in agriculture, healthcare.
